## Getting Started

Circles has already been live in the world for several years. We'll refer to this as Circles v1
and you can find details for Circles v1 below.

Since last year, we've been working hard on improvements
to the core protocol, and the [first testnet contracts](https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-contracts-v2/releases/tag/v0.3.4-alpha)
are accessible on [Chiado testnet](https://docs.gnosischain.com/about/networks/chiado), aka Circles v2.
