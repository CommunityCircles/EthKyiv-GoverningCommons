## Circles Bounties for EthKyiv 2024

Circles has USD 1400 for two, open-ended bounty tracks for EthKyiv:

1. **Integration track of Circles**: awarded to the best idea of integrating Circles with any existing DeFi, Social apps or protocols,
   SocialFi, ZK protocols, wallets, web2 apps, ... but make sure it is value-aligned ;-)

2. **Governing the Commons with Circles track**: awarded to the best implementation of Group Circles to "govern a common".

Either track requires to use either:
  - Circles v1 on Gnosis Chain mainnet
  - Circles v2 on Chiado testnet
  - or mocked Group Circles (ERC20, or ERC1155): the essense must be that 
    - community currencies have a relevant condition with which people can mint it
      (ie. mocked version of collateralizing their Circles under the same condition)
    - mock and implementation cannot violate core principles of Circles (eg. different issuence)

We aim to divide bounty equal over the two tracks, but we reserve the right to make a final
decision on how to distribute the total bounty after judging all submissions.
